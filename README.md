# Employee Management System

This is a simple Employee Management System implemented in Python. The system allows you to manage employee records, including adding new employees, listing all employees, deleting employees by age range, and updating employee salaries.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Add a new employee with their name, age, and salary.
- **List Employees**: Display a list of all employees with their details.
- **Delete by Age Range**: Delete employees whose age falls within a specified range.
- **Update Salary**: Update the salary of an employee by their name.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main Python files:

1. **Employee.py**: Contains the `EmployeeClass` which handles the core employee data management logic.
2. **EmployeeManager.py**: Contains the `EmployeeManagerClass` which acts as a bridge between the front-end and the employee data logic.
3. **FrontEndManager.py**: Contains the `FrontEndClass` which handles user interaction and input/output operations.
